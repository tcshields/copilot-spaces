# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

This repository documents the standardized project management processes used by OctoAcme to deliver high-quality projects efficiently and transparently.

## Overview

OctoAcme’s project management approach centers on structured workflows, clear roles, and continuous improvement. Projects begin with a formal initiation phase, using a Project One-pager to define the problem, goals, stakeholders, success metrics, and initial risks. This alignment step ensures all team members and stakeholders understand the project’s objectives before detailed planning begins. Progress is tracked transparently using project boards, regular documentation updates, and a cadence of reviews and retrospectives.

### Key Workflows

- **Project Boards:** Visual Kanban boards track work from backlog to done, with clear status columns and acceptance criteria.
- **Pull Request Workflow:** PRs link to tracked issues, follow acceptance criteria, run automated CI tests, and require review before merging.
- **Quality Assurance:** Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are required, with manual QA as needed. The CI pipeline enforces code quality and security standards before deployment.
- **Release & Retrospective:** Releases follow a documented checklist for deployment and rollback, and each release/sprint ends with a retrospective to capture learnings and drive improvements.

### Personas & Roles

- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communication.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and ensures customer/business value.
- **Developers:** Build and test features, maintain code quality, and participate in planning.
- **QA/Testing:** Validate deliverables against acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide input and approvals at key stages.

### Communication Strategies

- **Daily Standups & Weekly Syncs:** Regular meetings surface progress, blockers, and dependencies.
- **Written Updates:** Status reports, risk registers, and decision logs keep all stakeholders informed.
- **Escalation Paths:** Issues are triaged at the team level, then escalated to leads and sponsors as needed.

### Quality & Continuous Improvement

- **Testing & CI:** Automated and manual tests, security scans, and release checklists safeguard quality.
- **Retrospectives:** After each milestone, the team reviews what went well and identifies improvements, tracking action items for accountability.
- **Documentation:** All key processes, decisions, and learnings are kept in versioned docs to ensure consistency and reduce onboarding time.

By following these practices, OctoAcme enables repeatable, high-quality project execution and fosters a culture of transparency, collaboration, and continuous learning.
